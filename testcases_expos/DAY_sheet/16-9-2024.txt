1. get work reviewed by vinayak sir ex: testcases for create_business,edit_business and login_business
2. added changes given by him
3. gone through fuction inside fuction told by him
4. added test cases for list_business and noted 'two tickets to fix in xpos'
5.added test case for get_business_by_id route.
6. added python programs like :
   1. sort list of tuple by second argument
   2. traverse the nested dict issue i found while writtting testcase.
   3. used lambda and map fuction for converting the list of string to upercase
7. reading python crash course book by ERIC MATTHES :
   Topic :deleting the element from list :
   - using del we can delete at any position by using 'del list1[0]'
   - delete by using pop 'list1.pop()' delete last one

   - different between the pop and remove and del
	1. pop removes and return the item from list at specified (last if index not gven)
	2. when you want to delete an item from a list 
	   and not use that item in any way, use the del statement; if you want to use an 
	   item as you remove it, use the pop() method
	3.Sometimes you won’t know the position of the value you want to remove 
	from a list. If you only know the value of the item you want to remove, you 
	can use the remove() method
	3. The remove() method deletes only the first occurrence of the value you specify. If there’s 
	a possibility the value appears more than once in the list, you’ll need to use a loop to 
	determine if all occurrences of the value have been removed
	
	4. also gone thought generating the list of number usig range function
